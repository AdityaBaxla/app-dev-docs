# Understanding Variable Declarations and Hoisting in JavaScript

Variable declaration and hoisting are fundamental concepts in JavaScript that affect how and when variables are accessible in your code. This guide explores the behavior of `var`, `let`, `const`, and undeclared variables, with a focus on hoisting and the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ).

## Variable Declarations

### `var`

- **Declaration:** The `var` keyword is used to declare variables that are function-scoped or globally scoped, depending on where they are defined.
- **Hoisting:** Variables declared with `var` are hoisted to the top of their scope. This means that the declaration is processed before the code is executed, but the assignment remains in its original place.
- **Behavior:** The variable is initialized with `undefined` until the assignment is encountered.

**Example:**

```javascript
console.log(x); // Outputs: undefined
var x = 5;
console.log(x); // Outputs: 5
```

**Explanation:** The `console.log(x)` before the assignment outputs `undefined` due to hoisting. The variable `x` is hoisted but not its value.

### `let`

- **Declaration:** The `let` keyword is used to declare variables with block scope, which means they are confined to the block, statement, or expression where they are defined.
- **Hoisting:** Variables declared with `let` are also hoisted but are not initialized. They are in a "Temporal Dead Zone" (TDZ) from the start of the block until the declaration is encountered.
- **Behavior:** Accessing a `let` variable before its declaration within the TDZ results in a `ReferenceError`.

**Example:**

```javascript
console.log(x); // Throws ReferenceError: Cannot access 'x' before initialization
let x = 5;
console.log(x); // Outputs: 5
```

**Explanation:** The `ReferenceError` occurs because the variable `x` is in the TDZ until the declaration is reached.

### `const`

- **Declaration:** The `const` keyword is used to declare variables with block scope that cannot be reassigned after their initial assignment.
- **Hoisting:** Similar to `let`, `const` declarations are hoisted but are not initialized. They are also subject to the TDZ.
- **Behavior:** Attempting to reassign a `const` variable after its initial assignment results in a `TypeError`.

**Example:**

```javascript
console.log(x); // Throws ReferenceError: Cannot access 'x' before initialization
const x = 5;
console.log(x); // Outputs: 5

x = 10; // Throws TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```

**Explanation:** The `ReferenceError` occurs due to the TDZ, and the `TypeError` occurs because reassignment is not allowed for `const` variables.

### Undeclared Variables

- **Declaration:** Variables that are used without a declaration keyword (`var`, `let`, or `const`) are implicitly declared as global variables (in non-strict mode).
- **Behavior:** This can lead to unexpected behaviors and is considered a bad practice because it pollutes the global namespace.

**Example:**

```javascript
function example() {
  x = 5; // Implicit global declaration
}

example();
console.log(x); // Outputs: 5
```

**Explanation:** The variable `x` is implicitly declared as a global variable, which can lead to unintended side effects.

## Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)

The Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) refers to the time during which variables declared with `let` and `const` are in scope but not yet initialized. Accessing these variables in the TDZ results in a `ReferenceError`.

### TDZ Example:

```javascript
function example() {
  console.log(x); // Throws ReferenceError: Cannot access 'x' before initialization
  let x = 10;
}
example();
```

**Explanation:** The `ReferenceError` occurs because `x` is in the TDZ from the start of the block until the declaration is encountered.

## Common Console Errors

### ReferenceError

- **Cause:** Accessing a variable before its declaration (for `let` and `const`) or using an undeclared variable.
- **Example:**

  ```javascript
  console.log(x); // Throws ReferenceError: x is not defined
  ```

### TypeError

- **Cause:** Attempting to reassign a `const` variable or performing operations on variables in ways that are not allowed.
- **Example:**

  ```javascript
  const x = 10;
  x = 20; // Throws TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
  ```

## Summary

- **`var`**: Function-scoped or globally-scoped, hoisted with initialization to `undefined`. Can lead to issues due to its function-scoping.
- **`let`**: Block-scoped, hoisted but not initialized (TDZ). Accessing before declaration throws a `ReferenceError`.
- **`const`**: Block-scoped, hoisted but not initialized (TDZ). Cannot be reassigned after initial assignment; attempts result in a `TypeError`.
- **Undeclared Variables**: Automatically global (non-strict mode), which can cause unpredictable behavior.
- **TDZ**: The period where `let` and `const` variables are in scope but not yet initialized, causing `ReferenceError` if accessed.

Understanding these aspects of variable declarations and hoisting is crucial for writing reliable and maintainable JavaScript code. Properly managing variable scope and initialization can help avoid common pitfalls and errors in your programs.
