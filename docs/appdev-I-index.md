# Appdev I

Welcome to the Appdev I documentation! This section of the documentation is dedicated to the foundational aspects of Application Development. Whether you're a beginner or looking to solidify your knowledge, you'll find valuable resources here.

## Overview

Appdev I covers the essential skills and concepts required to build robust and scalable web applications. The course is divided into two main components: **Theory** and **Project**. Each component is designed to help you gain a comprehensive understanding of both the theoretical and practical sides of application development.

## Sections

### [Theory](./appdev-I-theory/)

In the Theory section, you'll explore the fundamental concepts of application development. Topics covered include:

- **Setting Up Your Development Environment:** Learn how to configure your machine for web development, including necessary tools and software.
- **Flask Setup:** Get familiar with Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python, and understand how to set up your first web application.
- **Flask Configuration:** Discover the best practices for configuring your Flask applications, ensuring they are secure, scalable, and maintainable.
- **Flask Security:** Explore how to implement security features such as authentication and authorization in your Flask applications.
- **Flask SQLAlchemy:** Understand how to interact with databases using SQLAlchemy, an ORM for Python, and how to model your data effectively.

### [Project](./appdev-I-project/)

The Project section guides you through the practical application of the concepts learned in the Theory section. You'll work on a real-world project that will challenge you to apply your knowledge and skills. Topics covered include:

- **Problem Statement:** A detailed description of the project you will be working on, including the objectives and expected outcomes.
- **Checks Before Submission:** A checklist of tasks and criteria to ensure your project meets all the necessary requirements before submission.
- **Important Deadlines:** Key dates and deadlines you need to keep track of to stay on schedule.
- **Do's and Don'ts:** Best practices and common pitfalls to avoid during your project work.
- **Guidelines:** Detailed instructions and tips to help you successfully complete your project.
